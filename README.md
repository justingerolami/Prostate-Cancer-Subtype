# prostate-cancer-subtype
This repository contains all code for the analysis and classification of prostate cancer molecular subtypes. This repository does not contain the code for the novel feature selection algorithm used for the paper. A download link will be provided for the feature selection tool upon completion of the project. 

In this project, I applied a novel feature selection algorithm to genetic data from prostate cancer patients. A machine learning classifier was developed. To show the usefulness of our feature selection algorithm, the model was applied to 1) genes selected using our feature selection algorithm and 2) differentially expressed genes for comparison.
